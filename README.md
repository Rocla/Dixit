# School Project of Web Development at HE-Arc NeuchÃ¢tel

[HTML5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/), [PHP](http://www.php.net), and [Laravel](http://laravel.com) adaptation of the Dixit card game.

## [Project live at: http://phanes.srvz-webapp.he-arc.ch](http://phanes.srvz-webapp.he-arc.ch)


## Brief Description

- It's a PRIVATE project (nobody has access to it expect people involved!!), plus this is a school project, and has for goal to learn the framework Laravel 5.
- In our case we took an existing project [Dixit-Online](https://github.com/PCreations/Dixit-Online) (which is PUBLICLY availibale on github, but without licence, meaning it's under copyright), and we will be insired by it to make the logic and and using the artworks of the game to conscentrate on the Framework [Laravel](http://laravel.com).
- Also note that the project [Dixit-Online](https://github.com/PCreations/Dixit-Online) is already under copyright infringement! Because it's a numerical version of a game under copyright, and it's using its artworks which are also under copyright!
- So, this project is cleary doing copyright infringement! We are conscious of that!
 - But, again, it's a school project, and its goal is to learn and practice the [Laravel](http://laravel.com) framework!
