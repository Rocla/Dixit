# Dixit Online
School Project of Web Development at HE-Arc NeuchÃ¢tel

[HTML5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/), [PHP](http://www.php.net), and [Laravel](http://laravel.com) adaptation of the Dixit card game.

## License

- All our source code is under MIT license.
- Copyright for the game itself and the artwork: [Libellud](http://en.libellud.com/games/dixit)

## Brief Description

- It's a SCHOOL project and has for goal to learn the framework Laravel 5.
- In our case we took an existing project [Dixit-Online](https://github.com/PCreations/Dixit-Online) (which is PUBLICLY availibale on github, but without licence, meaning it's under copyright) for the artworks of the game and we have been insired by their logic to make ours and be able to conscentrate on the Framework [Laravel](http://laravel.com).
- Also note that the project [Dixit-Online](https://github.com/PCreations/Dixit-Online) is already under copyright infringement itself! Because it's a digital version of a game under copyright, and it's using its artworks which are also under copyright!
- So, this project is, we believe, doing copyright infringement. We are conscious of that.
 - However, again, it's a school project, and its goal is to learn and practice the [Laravel](http://laravel.com) framework!
 - If you want us to take down this project just tell us, we will make it private.
